            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Hi, my name is Jack and I’m a freelance photographer living in Wellington, NZ</p>
            <p>From as far back as I can remember, I have always been fascinated with the art of still imagery. 
                I can vividly remember as a young child taking my parent's Nikon photo camera everywhere and experimenting with capturing special life moments.</p>        
            <p>My photographs have been published world wide, in magazines, as well as a wide variety of print and digital media such as books, websites, calendars etc.</p>
            <p>I am currently available for event, sport and portrait photography and you can reach my via the social links below or through the provided contact form. I look forward to hearing from you!</p>
